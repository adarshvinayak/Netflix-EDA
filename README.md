### Reccomendations derived from the insights

1. Over 69% of the netflix catalog are movies - movies seem to be trending

2. Data shows that over 2000 new content is uploaded on the 1st of every month, and over 600 during mid
month. Hence the recommended day to upload new content is the first of every month

3. The months in which content is uploaded seems to be stable throughout and mostly dependendent on the
release, however it is not recommended to upload content on the month of February as it showed the
lowest addition rate.

4. The top cast chart seems to be dominated by Indian actors such as Anupam Kher and Om Puri, however
the majority of releases are seen in the United States. Netflix should focus on releasing more content more
frequently in India.

5. The top 3 directors produce kids and comedy content, however the most number of content added are
International Movies, with over 2700 added, where as comedy is only at the 3rd position with a count of
1674 and kids content way below at around 600. Also according to the ratings, over 50% of the content is
for audiences 15 years and above. Hence it is highly recommended that more kids friendly content be
added to the platform to increase viewership. Netflix could also focus on adding kid friendly comedy shows
to get the benifit of both the younger and adult audience alike.

6. It is also worth noting that 2 directors among the 4 create animated movies and TV shows. More focus on
better animated content would also increase viewership mainly among children.
